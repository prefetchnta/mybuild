% Tested on macOS 12.4 Monterey VirtualBox (thanks to https://github.com/myspaghetti/macos-virtualbox)

1. Prerequisites for building zint and zint-qt
==============================================

Start a terminal.

First if not already installed, install the developer command line tools

    xcode-select --install

This can take a (very) long time. Once done, check for updates by selecting "System Preferences" > "Software Update",
and clicking "Advanced" and "OK" (with all the checkboxes set) to trigger the check. If updates are found, install.
This can also take a long time.

With the latest versions of the command line tools, "/usr/include" no longer has the standard C include files. Set
SDKROOT to overcome this (https://stackoverflow.com/a/60002595/664741)

    export SDKROOT=$(xcrun --sdk macosx --show-sdk-path)

Install Homebrew (unless already installed)

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

Install CMake, libpng and Qt5 (git, make, cc & c++ should already be available with command line tools)

    brew install cmake
    brew install libpng
    brew install qt5

Add the Qt5 bin directory to the PATH

    export PATH='/usr/local/opt/qt@5/bin':"$PATH"

Clone the latest zint source

    git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/zint/code zint


2. Build
========

The rest is standard CMake

   cd zint
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   sudo make install

This installs into "/usr/local". You can then move the GUI "/usr/local/bin/zint-qt.app" into the main "/Applications"
folder if you wish.


3. CMake options
================

See "README.linux".
