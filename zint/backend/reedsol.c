// It is not written with high efficiency in mind, so is probably
// not suitable for real-time encoding.  The aim was to keep it
// simple, general and clear.
//
// <Some notes on the theory and implementation need to be added here>

// Usage:
// First call rs_init_gf(poly) to set up the Galois Field parameters.
// Then  call rs_init_code(size, index) to set the encoding size
// Then  call rs_encode(datasize, data, out) to encode the data.
//
// These can be called repeatedly as required - but note that
// rs_init_code must be called following any rs_init_gf call.
//
// If the parameters are fixed, some of the statics below can be
// replaced with constants in the obvious way, and additionally
// malloc/free can be avoided by using static arrays of a suitable
// size.

#include <stdio.h>		// only needed for debug (main)
#include <stdlib.h>		// only needed for malloc/free
#include "reedsol.h"

// rs_init_gf(poly) initialises the parameters for the Galois Field.
// The symbol size is determined from the highest bit set in poly
// This implementation will support sizes up to 30 bits (though that
// will result in very large log/antilog tables) - bit sizes of
// 8 or 4 are typical
//
// The poly is the bit pattern representing the GF characteristic
// polynomial.  e.g. for ECC200 (8-bit symbols) the polynomial is
// a**8 + a**5 + a**3 + a**2 + 1, which translates to 0x12d.
