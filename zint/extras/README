This folder contains some extra tools to provide functionality which
may be useful, or just interesting, but fall outside the remit of the
Zint program. These small programs have been written by Robin Stuart
and are released to the public domain.

Font Encoding Tools
-------------------
daft.c
ida_2d.c
stroke.c
zebu_pdf.c

These code snippets show how Zint can be used to create the text
necessary to display symbols using a range of fonts available online.
See the individual files for information about the specific fonts.
Some of these fonts are free whereas others require licensing, check the
specific websites before use.

Obsolete Symbologies
--------------------
cuecat.c
kartrak.c
sunburst.c

These are stand-alone tools for encoding data in some more obscure and
obsolete formats. More information is given within the file.
