BEFORE POSTING TO THE LIST
--------------------------
Please note the following points...
* You do not need to join the list to post messages, although joining
  the list will usually mean your request is answered more promptly.
* Zint is primarily developed for Linux. If you are using another platform
  then we will be less able to help you, although we will do so if we can.
  We cannot provide support for commercial packages such as MS Office or
  Crystal Reports.
* Always ensure you are using the latest version of Zint before posting bug
  reports - the bug you are reporting may have been fixed already.
* Please remember to state what operating system you are using and include
  enough information to allow us to reproduce the error - including input
  data if appropriate.
* Please DO NOT post messages asking for us to change the license
  arrangements. You will be ignored. If you want a barcode encoder with a
  different license then please look elsewhere.
* Please remember that Zint is developed by volunteers - don't be surprised
  if we are unable to help you or if it takes a long time to answer your
  questions.
